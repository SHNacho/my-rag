# My Hobbies: A Journey of Growth and Passion

## 1. Overview of My Hobbies

I have a diverse range of hobbies that keep me engaged, relaxed, and constantly learning. My main hobbies include reading economic and personal growth books, baking, coding, and participating in various sports like hiking and skiing. These hobbies have played a significant role in shaping my daily life, personality, and even career.

## 2. How I Got Started

My hobbies have different origins and serve unique purposes in my life:

- **Baking**: I began baking two years ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdowns provided an opportunity to try something new, and I found baking to be both calming and rewarding.
- **Coding**: I’ve been passionate about coding for seven years now. Since childhood, I’ve been fascinated by technology and the idea of creating things just by writing code. Coding felt like a natural extension of my interests and is now an integral part of my life.
- **Sports**: Sports, especially hiking and skiing, have always been part of my life. They give me a way to connect with nature and maintain a healthy, active lifestyle.

## 3. What I Enjoy About Each Hobby

Each of my hobbies offers something different, but they all contribute to my sense of fulfillment:

- **Baking**: I find baking to be a relaxing activity that offers a sense of satisfaction when I successfully create a perfect loaf of bread.
- **Coding**: Coding is not only my job as a data scientist but also my creative outlet. It’s incredible to be able to create useful projects with nothing more than a laptop and an idea.
- **Sports**: Engaging in outdoor sports, especially hiking, helps me connect with nature and recharge mentally and physically.

## 4. Incorporating Hobbies into My Routine

My hobbies have become an essential part of my daily and weekly routine:

- **Sports**: I try to incorporate some form of physical activity daily, whether it’s a simple walk or something more intense. On weekends, I usually go hiking.
- **Baking**: I bake bread once a week, often when I know I’ll be at home for a long stretch since baking requires patience and waiting for the dough to ferment.
- **Coding**: Coding is something I do every day. It’s part of my professional life and my personal projects, where I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and developing tools or websites.

## 5. The Details of Each Hobby

Here’s a closer look at what these hobbies entail:

- **Baking**: Baking requires a lot of time, especially for bread-making, as the dough needs to ferment properly. It’s an activity I plan for carefully, usually when I’m staying home for a while.
- **Sports**: I often go hiking with my girlfriend, Blanca, and one of our favorite spots is the Sierra Nevada Natural Park, where the scenery is breathtaking.
- **Coding**: My coding projects range from professional data science tasks to personal projects like developing my own website.

## 6. Overcoming Challenges and Growing

Each hobby has its challenges, and I’ve learned a lot from overcoming them:

- **Baking**: At first, baking bread was difficult because it’s hard to tell when the dough is ready. But over time, I’ve learned to recognize the perfect moment to bake or wait for better fermentation.
- **Coding**: Coding has taught me the value of problem-solving and perseverance. Not every project works out immediately, but persistence and logical thinking help me push through obstacles.

## 7. Personal Growth through Hobbies

My hobbies have contributed immensely to my personal growth:

- **Sports**: Engaging in sports has helped me develop discipline and hard work.
- **Reading**: Reading, especially economic and personal growth books, has shaped my worldview and personality. I believe reading is one of the best ways to learn about the world, far more enriching than passively watching television.
- **Coding**: Coding has helped me become a better problem solver. It’s a skill that requires patience, creativity, and resilience, all of which have improved through years of practice.

## 8. Achievements and Milestones

I’ve had several notable achievements through my hobbies:

- **Sports**: I’ve won a few swimming competitions, though I’ve also had my share of defeats, particularly in football. One of my proudest moments was climbing the highest mountains in Spain.
- **Coding**: I’ve developed my own personal website, which showcases my skills and serves as a platform for my projects.

## 9. Future Goals

Looking ahead, I have some exciting goals related to my hobbies:

- **Baking**: In the future, I’d love to open my own bakery, turning my passion for baking into a business.
- **Coding**: I also have dreams of starting my own technology business, using my coding and data science expertise to create impactful solutions.
